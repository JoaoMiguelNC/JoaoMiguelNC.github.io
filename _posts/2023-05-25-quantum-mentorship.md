# Introduction

Quantum supremacy is the goal that a quantum computer can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in a feasible amount of time. Some areas where this speed up would occur are factoring integers, simulation a quantum system, or solving linear equations. However, quantum computers are still very sensitive to errors, preventing the implementation of these complex tasks.  

There are, however, areas where simple quantum algorithms are being used, for example, quantum key distribution. But for anything complex, classical computers are still our go to. This forms the basis of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing - using quantum computers where they can be used and then outsource difficult calculations to a classical computer.   

Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) is a type of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing. The objective of a VQA is to approximate some value using a parameterized quantum circuit by using a quantum computer to calculate quantum values and passing them on to a classical optimization algorithm to improve the parameters. 


In [1] the authors take a different approach, instead of optimizing over the parameter space, they optimize directly over the special unitary group using Riemann gradient flow. They derived the Riemann gradient for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and build circuits that could compute it.  

For QOSF Quantum Computing Mentorship Program we expanded on the previous mentioned work and derived the gradient flow for other cost functions.

# Variational Quantum Algorithm

A VQA is used when we want to aproximate a quantum operator $$U$$ to extimate a value 
$$U|0\rangle$$. 
For that we consider a parameterized quantum circuit $$U(\theta)$$ whose parrameter $$\theta$$ is optimized using a classical algorithm with a relevant cost function $${\cal L}(\theta)$$ (or its gradient $$\nabla{\cal L}(\theta)$$) calculated using a quantum computer.

For the optimization we are interested in the gradient descent. Thus we can minimize the cost function considering the flow

$$\dot{\theta} = - \nabla{\cal L}(\theta)$$

And we have a recursive method of calculating the next iteration of $$\theta$$

$$\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \epsilon\nabla{\cal L}(\theta)$$

# Riemann Gradient Flow

In [1] the authors propose doing the optimization over the matrix $$U$$ instead of the parameter space.

Now the cost is a function of $$U$$ and we have (meter qualquer coisa que o grad(L) Ã© da forma f(U)U e que por isso vamos usar grad para nos referirmos a f(U)U e a f(U) e que pelo contexto fica claro, neste caso estamos a usar a segunda)

$$\dot{U} = - \mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U)\cdot U$$

Which leads to

$$U_{k+1} = \exp(- \epsilon\cdot\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U_k))$$

# Special Unitary Differential Manifold
The special unitary Lie group is the set of $$n\times n$$ unitary matrices with determinant 1, that is

$$\mathrm{SU}(n)=\{X\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\!: X^\dagger X=I, \det(X)=1\}$$

$$\mathrm{SU}(n)$$ is a differential manifold and given $$U\in\mathrm{SU}(n)$$ the tangent space at $$U$$ is

$$T_U\mathrm{SU}(n)=\{V\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\!: V^\dagger U + U^\dagger V = 0 \ \wedge \ \mathrm{tr}(U^\dagger V)=0\}$$

Thus, the corresponding Lie algebra, $$\mathfrak{su}(n)$$, is the tangent space at the identity

$$\mathfrak{su}(n)=\{\Omega\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\!: \Omega^\dagger=-\Omega \ \wedge \ \mathrm{tr}\,\Omega=0\}$$

# Computing the Gradient

## Cost Function 1

In [1] they compute the gradient for the cost function 

$${\cal L}(U) = \mathrm{tr}(HU\rho_oU^\dagger)$$

Obtaining 

$$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U) = - [U\rho_0U^\dagger, H]U$$

For simplicity we'll call $$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U)$$ to the part $$- [U\rho_0U^\dagger, H]$$ so that it fits nicelly in the equation

$$\dot{U} = - \epsilon\cdot\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U)\cdot U$$

## Cost Function 2

We computed the gradient for the cost function used in [2]

$${\cal L}(U) = 1 - \frac{1}{4^n}|\mathrm{tr}(V^\dagger U)|^2$$

And we got

$$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U) = - \frac{1}{4^n}\left(\mathrm{tr}(VU^\dagger)UV^\dagger - \mathrm{tr}(V^\dagger U)VU^\dagger\right)U$$

## Cost Function 3

To find the solution of a linear equation $$Ax=b$$ we can obtimze a unitary $$U$$ such that 
$$U|0\rangle$$
approximates $$|x\rangle$$ using the cost function

$${\cal L}(U) = 1 - \frac{|\langle b|AU|0\rangle|^2}{\lVert AU|0\rangle \rVert^2}$$

For this function the gradient is

$$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U) = \left[ U|0\rangle\langle 0|U^\dagger, \frac{fA^\dagger A - gA^\dagger|b\rangle\langle b|A}{g^2} \right]U$$

where 
$$f := \mathrm{tr}(U|0\rangle\langle 0|U^\dagger A^\dagger|b\rangle\langle b|A)$$ 
and 
$$g := U|0\rangle\langle 0|U^\dagger A^\dagger A$$.

## Cost Function 4
For the mean square error, with $$y_i\in\{-1, 1\}$$, the loss function is

$${\cal L}(U) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left( \mathrm{tr}(OU\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger) - y_i \right)^2$$

And the gradient is

$$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U) = -\frac{1}{2m}\left( 2(\mathrm{tr}(OU\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger) - y_i)[U\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger, O] \right)U$$

## Cost Function 5
For the cross entropy, with $$y_i\in\{0, 1\}$$, the loss function is

$${\cal L}(U) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m\left(y_i\log f(U; x_i) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 - f(U; x_i))\right)$$

where $$f(U; x_i) := (\mathrm{tr}(OU\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger) + 1)/2$$

The gradient for this loss function is

$$\mathrm{grad}{\cal L}(U) = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_i \frac{T_i + 1 - 2y_i}{T_i^2 - 1}[U\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger, O] \right)U$$

where $$T_i:=\mathrm{tr}(OU\rho_0(x_i)U^\dagger)$$
